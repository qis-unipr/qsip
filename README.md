# Quantum Software for Improved Privacy (QSIP)

The QSIP project focuses on the implementation of quantum-based cryptographic schemes that have been proven to be correct and robust, but not yet implemented in software, as suitable hardware has been released only recently. 

For example, QSIP will implement the set of protocols proposed by Unnikrishnan et al. ([arXiv:1811.04729](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04729)) to guarantee the anonymity of two parties, the sender and the receiver, when they wish to transmit a message through the network.

Leveraging existing open source software tools for simulating and even controlling real quantum devices, such as SimulaQron, ProjectQ and Qiskit, QSIP will implement protocol stacks and demonstrative applications.
